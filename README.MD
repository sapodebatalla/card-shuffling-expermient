# Shuffling cards experiment
So, it's 5AM and after losing like 10 Warzone games in a row
an intrusive thought came to me: "How many times do you need to shuffle
a deck of cards to get it to its starting point?"
I don't know, I'm no mathematician, what I am is drunk and a programmer.

So I did absolutely no research at all and wrote this scripts.
